# Designing

Here we'll learn how to use [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). Some people design straight in code, some people just sketch a general concept, some design in photoshop. I've grown to really like Sketch. It's intuitive and made specifically for digital product design, so that's what we'll cover in the lesson. Feel free to use any medium to design the look and feel. Remember that this is our first website so don't get too crazy with a fancy design because whatever we design here we'll have to build later. A wireframe isn't set in stone, as you build you might find that other layouts, elements, etc. work better so treat your design as a starting point.

## Lesson
- [Design a login form](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/sketch-for-beginners-design-a-login-form-interface--cms-21534) - **2 hours**

## Project
For our first website we'll be making a static website to raise awareness for your favorite cause (human trafficking, aides, world hunger, contraception in India, car racing club, etc.). We'll limit ourselves to a single page. Using a variety of boxes, images, and text create the most compelling design for your cause.

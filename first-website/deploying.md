# Deploying

## Project
This can be as hard as you want it to be. I searched for *static website hosting* and found [a great article](http://alignedleft.com/resources/cheap-web-hosting) comparing different hosting solutions and [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/), a dead simple way to host a website. Drag your project folder into BitBalloon and you're live!

If you want a custom domain, buy one (I like to use [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com)) and read up on [how to use a custom domain](https://www.bitballoon.com/docs/custom_domains/) with BitBalloon.

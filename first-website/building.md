## Project
We'll get started by setting up our *development environment*. First download our text editor, [Atom](https://atom.io/). We'll use atom to edit our code. Now we need someway to get and save our code to the internet so we can collaborate with other coders and create snapshots of our code over time, so let's download [Github for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). If you don't already have a Github Account [create one](https://github.com/join). Now for our file system. We need somewhere to save all of our cool projects. Let's create a new folder in our home directory (typically this is the your name or the name of your computer) called `Code`.

Nice! Now that we have a github account, an application to access github, a folder for your things, and a text editor, you can call yourself a coder! Well almost... let's get our first project done.

First thing to know about coding: the best coders build off of what other people have done. It's not like we are still making websites in binary with 1s and 0s. An integral part of development is googling. So right now we are looking for some *HTML boilerplate* that we can inject our code into. Let's google *HTML boilerplate* and click on the first link. Hmm... looks like we have what we need. Download the boilerplate and move the folder to your `Code` directory. Let's rename the folder to the name of our cause.

Now to edit it. Take the cause folder from finder and drag it onto your Atom in your dock. The folder should open up in the text editor and you have access to all of your boilerplate. We have a folder for javascript (`js`), for styling (`css`), and for images (`img`).

Now get to it! Start at `index.html` and add some HTML and some css and raise awareness! Below are some helpful references to keep you chugging along.

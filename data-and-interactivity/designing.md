# Designing

Two important facets of digital design are fonts and colors. In our lessons today we'll generate a color palette and pick a font that reflects the tone we'd like to convey for our list app. For something like a list of puppies we would want to pick a font and color scheme that reflects a fun, bubbly, cozy, playful tone. If we are creating a list of US prisons then we would want a dark, oppressive tone.  

## Lesson
- [Creating a color palette](https://coolors.co) - **10 min**
- [Picking fonts](http://fontsinuse.com/) - **10 min**

## Project
Let's break out sketch again and spend some time mocking up what our app will look like on a HD standard computer screen. Using the `a` shortcut, pick your artboard and mock up two or three items in the 
list. 

I like to make five squares with the color palette so I can use the dropper tool when editing colors for type, borders or fills. Make five squares and add the colors you picked from your lesson. Also let's download and install the font you selected by double clicking the font to save it to your OSX font book. 

Be sure to write actual mock content so you can see if various content lengths fit within the space you allot. Be sure to include an add button, an edit button, a title, a description and a rating in the list items. Then somewhere on the page include a place to enter a new list item.

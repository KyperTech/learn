## First website
By the end of this module you will have designed and built your first website. It's not going to be pretty and probably won't generate 1 million views, but you'll have code that is internet ready. Make and account at [code cademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)

### Lessons
- [Make a website](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website) ** - 3 hours**

### Project
Let's make a ... We'll get started by setting up our *development environment*. First download our text editor, [Atom](https://atom.io/). We'll use atom to edit our code. Now we need someway to get and save our code to the internet so we can collaborate with other coders and create snapshots of our code over time, so let's download [Github for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). If you don't already have a Github Account [create one](https://github.com/join).

# Learn
The primer for web design and development. This is a time intensive course that currently can be completed in 3 days with about 3-4 hours of daily dedication.

This is a work in progress and currently only covers basic web development. Keep an eye out for updates :) *Psst! Once you create a Github account you can click the watch button at the top. Also click the star if you like what you see.*

<!-- Each lesson will specify what tabs should be open and approximately how long it will take. -->








### Deploying

#### Project
This can be as hard as you want it to be. I searched for *static website hosting* and found [a great article](http://alignedleft.com/resources/cheap-web-hosting) comparing different hosting solutions and [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/), a dead simple way to host a website. Drag your project folder into BitBalloon and you're live!

If you want a custom domain, buy one (I like to use [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com)) and read up on [how to use a custom domain](https://www.bitballoon.com/docs/custom_domains/) with BitBalloon.

## Playing with data and interactivity
This will be your introduction to javascript. We will use it to add interactivity to a web app and use it to retrieve and manipulate data from an HTTP endpoint.

### Designing
Two very important facets of digital design are fonts and colors.

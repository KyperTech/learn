# Learn
The primer for web design and development. This is a time intensive course that currently can be completed in 3 days with about 3-4 hours of daily dedication.

This is a work in progress and currently only covers basic web development. Keep an eye out for updates :) *Psst! Once you create a Github account you can click the watch button at the top. Also click the star if you like what you see.*

## First website
By the end of this module you will have designed and built your first website. It's not going to be pretty and probably won't generate 1 million views, but you'll have code that is internet ready.

### Designing
Here we'll learn how to use [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). Some people design straight in code, some people just sketch a general concept, some design in photoshop. I've grown to really like Sketch. It's very intuitive and made specifically for digital product design so that's what we'll cover in the lesson, but feel free to use any medium to design the look and feel. Remember that this is our first website so don't get too crazy with a fancy design because whatever we design here we'll have to build later. A wireframe isn't set in stone, as you build you might find that other layouts, elements, etc. work better so treat your design as a starting point.

#### Lesson
- [Design a login form](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/sketch-for-beginners-design-a-login-form-interface--cms-21534) - **2 hours**

#### Project
For our first website we'll be making a static website to raise awareness for your favorite cause (human trafficking, aides, world hunger, contraception in India, car racing club, etc.). We'll limit ourselves to a single page. Using a variety of boxes, images, and text create the most compelling design for your cause.

### Building

#### Lesson
- [Make a website](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website) - **3 hours**

#### Project
We'll get started by setting up our *development environment*. First download our text editor, [Atom](https://atom.io/). We'll use atom to edit our code. Now we need someway to get and save our code to the internet so we can collaborate with other coders and create snapshots of our code over time, so let's download [Github for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). If you don't already have a Github Account [create one](https://github.com/join). Now for our file system. We need somewhere to save all of our cool projects. Let's create a new folder in our home directory (typically this is the your name or the name of your computer) called `Code`.

Nice! Now that we have a github account, an application to access github, a folder for your things, and a text editor, you can call yourself a coder! Well almost... let's get our first project done.

First thing to know about coding: the best coders build off of what other people have done. It's not like we are still making websites in binary with 1s and 0s. An integral part of development is googling. So right now we are looking for some *HTML boilerplate* that we can inject our code into. Let's google *HTML boilerplate* and click on the first link. Hmm... looks like we have what we need. Download the boilerplate and move the folder to your `Code` directory. Let's rename the folder to the name of our cause.

Now to edit it. Take the cause folder from finder and drag it onto your Atom in your dock. The folder should open up in the text editor and you have access to all of your boilerplate. We have a folder for javascript (`js`), for styling (`css`), and for images (`img`).

Now get to it! Start at `index.html` and add some HTML and some css and raise awareness! Below are some helpful references to keep you chugging along.

### Deploying

#### Project
This can be as hard as you want it to be. I searched for *static website hosting* and found [a great article](http://alignedleft.com/resources/cheap-web-hosting) comparing different hosting solutions and [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/), a dead simple way to host a website. Drag your project folder into BitBalloon and you're live!

If you want a custom domain, buy one (I like to use [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com)) and read up on [how to use a custom domain](https://www.bitballoon.com/docs/custom_domains/) with BitBalloon.

## Playing with data and interactivity
This will be your introduction to javascript. We will use it to add interactivity to a web app and use it to retrieve and manipulate data from an HTTP endpoint.

### Designing
Two very important facets of digital design are fonts and colors.

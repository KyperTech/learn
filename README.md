# Learn
The primer for web design and development. This is a time intensive course that currently can be completed in 3 days with about 3-4 hours of daily dedication.

This is a work in progress and currently only covers basic web development. Keep an eye out for updates :) *Psst! Once you create a Github account you can click the watch button at the top. Also click the star if you like what you see.*

<!-- Each lesson will specify what tabs should be open and approximately how long it will take. -->
